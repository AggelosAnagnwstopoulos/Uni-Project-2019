This is part of the 24th team's exam for the lesson Introduction to computer science ECE.106 for the academic year 2018-2019
The project assigned was to create an implementation of the infamous board game "Snakes n' Ladders" using either Pygame or Tkinter.
We decided to put both to the test and see each one's strengths and weaknesses, so we created 2 projects, one for each module.
This repository contains the Tkinter part of the exam that was assigned to me (code and images needed to work).
